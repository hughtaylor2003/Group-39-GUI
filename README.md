first commit: 

Added by Jason:
Extra Options has been modified. <br />
(includes changing colour of panel background. Made text colour black since it was kinda hard to see. Made details dynamic as they can change by clicking on day panel) <br />
Changed the current weather forecast to include icons for weather details. <br />
Current weather + Extra options section should be responsive. <br />

to add:
settings - Add more options in settings <br />
extras - Add more extra option panels to this section <br />
bookmarks - Should move Justin's bookmark system into the code. <br />
sunrise/sunset direction - possibly use addition API for this (research) <br />
current weather forecast - Make advice reponsive so that appropriate advice is given e.g 'heatpacks for cold days', 'rain proof equipment for rainy days' <br />

nice to add: 
make it 24 hrs in daily forecast <br />
maybe add option to see more details per hr in daily forecast e.g see wind speed, humidity and chance of precipitation every hr <br />
