first commit: 

Added by Jason:
Extra Options has been modified.
(includes changing colour of panel background. Made text colour black since it was kinda hard to see. Made details dynamic as they can change by clicking on day panel)
Changed the current weather forecast to include icons for weather details. 
Current weather + Extra options section should be responsive.

to add:
settings - Add more options in settings
extras - Add more extra option panels to this section 
bookmarks - Should move Justin's bookmark system into the code.
sunrise/sunset direction - possibly use addition API for this (research)

nice to add: 
make it 24 hrs in daily forecast
maybe add option to see more details per hr in daily forecast e.g see wind speed, humidity and chance of precipitation every hr
